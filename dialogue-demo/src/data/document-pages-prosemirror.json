(2023) and Johnson & Williams (2022) have established a theoretical framework that emphasizes the importance of multi-dimensional analysis in this domain. Their work builds upon earlier foundations laid by pioneering researchers in the 1990s.</p><p><strong>Current Gaps</strong></p><p>Despite significant progress, several gaps remain in the literature. Most notably, there is a lack of longitudinal studies examining long-term effects, and cross-cultural validation of findings remains limited.</p>"
